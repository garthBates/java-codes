# What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is NOT Java
  - "JavaScript is to Java as car is to carpet"
- JavaScript is a scripting language (Meant for lightweight tasks)
- JavaScript was historically made in 10 days by a man named Brendan Eich
- JavaScript was made to run in the browser

- Interpreted Language
- Loosely Typed Language (Dynamic Typed)
  - No explicit type definitions (There are types, they are just implicit)
- JS is geared for BOTH OOP and functional programming

- In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser and with it a new JS runtime (known as V8)
- In 2009, the V8 engine was repurposed to serve as the runtime environment for NodeJs (server side JS)
